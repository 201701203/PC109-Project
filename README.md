# PC109-Project
Line Follower Robot using Transistor

This project was assigned as a part of Engineering Design Workshop course. We were supposed to build a line follower bot which follows a marked path. We used IR sensor and LDR to detect the marked path and alter the current through the circuit accordingly. Printed Circuit Board was given to us and we had to implement the circuit on it. We were also supposed to choose optimal design for our bot such that its speed is maximum.
